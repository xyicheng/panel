     <p>
      (As of 10/2018)
     </p>
     <p>
      The Panel library is new, but it builds on at least a decade of work
in previous and related Python projects. Thus there are many parts of Panel
that are very solidly implemented, with features that have been tested
and improved over years of active use by large communities of Bokeh
and Param users. Other features are new to Panel itself or were added
to support Panel, and will gradually become more solid as they get
into widespread use.
     </p>
     <p>
      The currently funded priority items for development in 2018-2019
include:
     </p>
     <ol class="arabic simple">
      <li>
       <strong>
        Polishing the new features, documentation, and examples
       </strong>
       :
As issues, bugs, and usabilty gaps are reported on the issue
tracker, we will address these as time permits.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        GridSpec
       </strong>
       : Panels can currently be created using
       <code class="docutils literal notranslate">
        <span class="pre">
         interact()
        </span>
       </code>
       or as nested
       <code class="docutils literal notranslate">
        <span class="pre">
         pn.Row()
        </span>
       </code>
       or
       <code class="docutils literal notranslate">
        <span class="pre">
         pn.Column()
        </span>
       </code>
       objects, potentially with
       <code class="docutils literal notranslate">
        <span class="pre">
         pn.Spacer()
        </span>
       </code>
       objects to adjust spacing.  A complementary approach
like Matplotlib’s
       <a class="reference external" href="https://matplotlib.org/users/gridspec.html">
        GridSpec
       </a>
       makes it
simpler to make an arrangement into a regular grid by defining the
total rows and columns from the start, then assigning individual
panes to specifc ranges of rows and columns in the grid. An
       <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pyviz/panel/pull/31">
        initial implementation
       </a>
       is underway, but it will need more work before it becomes usable.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Widget improvements
       </strong>
       : There are many improvements needed to the
detais of the provided widgets, such as making numeric values
editable, improving the stepsize behavior, making layouts more
compact, lining up widgets better, combining multiple related
widgets per row, allowing widget groups to be laid out
horizontally, and so on. These improvements will happen gradually,
and mostly depend on changes to the underlying Bokeh library.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Other features we’d love to see in Panel but which are not currently
funded or scheduled include:
     </p>
     <ol class="arabic simple">
      <li>
       <strong>
        Static export
       </strong>
       : Panel widgets are currently only “live” when
backed by a Python server, but in many cases the mapping from widget
to displayed object follows a well-defined pattern, which can
be captured in JavaScript code that runs with or without a Python
process. Supporting static export to .html that can be sent in an
email or posted on any website will require capturing these
typical communication patterns, as well as providing a set
of communication channels to ship with exported documents. Examples
of the results of this general approach are on
       <a class="reference external" href="http://holoviews.org">
        holoviews.org
       </a>
       , but
Panel will need its own separate implementation for static export.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Other plotting libraries
       </strong>
       : Panel already supports a wide variety
of libraries, including all the libraries currently in use by the
authors or their collaborators.  Most other libraries can trivially
be supported as well, if anyone can provide an example of a plot
already supported by Panel converted into this other library.
As mentioned in
       <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pyviz/panel/issues/2">
        issue 2
       </a>
       ,
the ipywidgets-based libraries will be more complicated to support,
but any library that produces PNG, SVG, HTML, or another basic
type should be very straightforward to include.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Themes
       </strong>
       : By default, Panel apps use Bokeh’s default theming,
but other look-and-feel options can be provided by using other
available Bokeh themes, making your own, or embedding into a Bokeh
Jinja2 template. We’ll add examples of such theming to the Panel
website as we develop them.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Responsive sizing
       </strong>
       : Panel objects (panes and similar viewable
items) currently accept a fixed height and width in pixels.  In
many cases, it’s desirable to have at least some of the objects
responsively adjust to the screen size available, so that they can
make use of whatever screen or window area is available. Responsive
sizing can be implemented once Bokeh’s current layout-refactoring
project has been completed.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        BI tools
       </strong>
       : Panel is designed for displaying content that you
already have developed in a Jupyter notebook, but it could also
be used as a way for building business-intelligence-style
dashboards that mix traditional Python plotting output with
BI-style indicators like speedometers, single number displays
(e.g. stock tickers), and so on.  Adding a small number of
such plots or widgets could help make it simpler to build
BI-type dashboards where the content comes directly from
Python.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Jupyter notebook extension
       </strong>
       : The Jupyter-Dashboards project
provided a
       <a class="reference external" href="https://jupyter-dashboards-layout.readthedocs.io">
        Jupyter extension
       </a>
       allowing drag and drop layout for Jupyter notebook cells. This
approach worked well in many cases, but the underlying server used
for deployment is no longer maintained, and so that approach remains
only a proof of concept. Panel, on the other hand, is fully deployable
outside of the notebook as well as in it, and so it would be great
to have a drag-and-drop interface either based on the
Jupyter-Dashboards project or developed separately to provide similar
capabilities. As for Jupyter Dashboards, the layout information
could be stored as cell metadata in the notebook, providing hints
for Panel to set up the dashboard layout when served separately.
There are likely to be tricky issues with control flow that would
need to be addressed when a notebook is used in a non-linear
dashboard in this way.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Support for Traitlets
       </strong>
       : Panel currently supports declarative user
interfaces for objects defined using the Param library, and similar
support could be added for objects defined using the Traitlets
library. Traitlets and Param offer similar functionality, so the
benefit of adding Traitlets support would primarily be for users
who have large bodies of code already written as traitlets.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If any of the functionality above is interesting to you (or you have
ideas of your own!) and can offer help with implementation, please
open an issue on this repository. And if you are lucky enough to be in
a position to fund our developers to work on it, please contact
